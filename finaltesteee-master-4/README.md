The idea behind TRAVELNOW is to provide a fast & simple way to travel and go from
place to place with the least amount of effort. 
The Inspiration behind the design is a modern & futuristic look that would 
be simple, minimalistic, easy to understand for all age groups and provide
a clean, fast and interactive experience. 

There are 4 Pages involved :

- The Homepage (the front and starting page)
- The Registration Page (Where users would register and/or login)
- The Travel Page (where the users would go to in order to complete their travel plans)
- The Contact Page (contact information)


* The layouts and the interface were made using bootstrap and its grid system.
* The Registration Page contains a validation form made in Javascript
* If the user fails to fill in the validation form a series of error messages
will be display under the text boxes.
* The Travel Page contains a slider that showcases before & after pictures that
were edited and retouched in Photoshop CC. The pictures were chosen accordingly
in order to stay in theme with the travel website aesthetic.

(the API I added on the contact page glitched the entire page and I could not find any 
solution on how to fix the issue therefore I removed it).
